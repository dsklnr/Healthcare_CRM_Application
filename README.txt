Directions:
Click run. This opens the main screen where the user may either create a new account or login. Once logged in, the user
enters the dashboard screen. Here you can view a table of upcoming appointments within the next month unique to that
user. There are two toggle buttons that toggle upcoming appointments within the next month or week. In the top right
corner of the GUI there are clickable labels that lead to new pages. These labels are home (the dashboard screen),
customers, schedule appointment, and generate reports. The customers screen displays all customers in a table view.
A user can add a new customer to this table, select a user to modify, or select a user to delete. If a customer has a
scheduled appointment, they may not be deleted until the appointment is deleted. The schedule appointments screen displays
a table view of all appointments. On this page functionality to schedule a new appointment, modify a selected appointment,
and delete a selected appointment is built into the application. The reports screen displays three table views.
The first is a table that displays the total number of customer appointments by type and month. The second displays
the number of customers in each division. The third table displays a schedule for each contact within the organization
organized by customer ID.
